# Wordpress Load More API Example

This Sample code uses ES6/gulp/node to compile, I've only included a few of the [Timber](http://upstatement.com/timber/) files so that you could easily integrate into your own Timber Wordpress site. However the only part you really need is the JS for load more.

## Installation

* Install  [node](https://nodejs.org)
* Navigate to `wp-content/themes/timber-sample/build-system`
* run `npm install`

## Usage

* `gulp` to start Webpack in watch mode as well as trigger livereload when bundle.js or index.html changes.
* Change or add files in `es6` folder. `main.js` is the entry point.
